Great! Since you are using a **virtual environment**, I'll include the steps for setting it up and activating it in the **`README.md`** file.

---

## **📌 `README.md` (Django Signals Testing Guide)**

```md
# Django Signals Testing

This repository demonstrates how **Django signals** work, covering:
- **Synchronous execution** of signals.
- **Signals running in the same thread** as the caller.
- **Signals running within the same database transaction**.

---

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
If you haven't already cloned the repository, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vasu2901/AccuknoxAssignment.git
cd django-signals-demo
```

---

### **2️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
Create a virtual environment (if not already set up):
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

---

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**
After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install django
```

---

### **4️⃣ Set Up Django Project**
1. Navigate to your Django project folder:
   ```bash
   cd accuknox
   ```

2. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

---

## 🛠 **Running the Signals Tests**

1. Start the Django shell:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   ```
2. Inside the Django shell, import the test script:
   ```python
   import testapp.test
   ```

---

## 📌 **Expected Output**
After running the tests, you should see something like this:

```
>>> import testapp.test   
Main thread ID: 7768

>>> Testing Synchronous Execution
Sync Signal handler started
Sync Signal handler finished
Thread Signal handler running in thread: 7768
Transaction Signal received.
User exists in DB: True

>>> Testing Same-Thread Execution
Sync Signal handler started
Sync Signal handler finished
Thread Signal handler running in thread: 7768
Transaction Signal received.
User exists in DB: True

>>> Testing Transaction Behavior
Sync Signal handler started
Sync Signal handler finished
Thread Signal handler running in thread: 7768
Transaction Signal received.
User exists in DB: True
User created but transaction not committed yet
Transaction committed
```

---

## ❌ **Troubleshooting**
If you encounter any issues, try the following:

1. **Ensure the virtual environment is activated**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # (Mac/Linux)
   venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
   ```

2. **Ensure the database migrations are applied**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **If signals are not working, check `apps.py`** to make sure signals are loaded:
   ```python
   def ready(self):
       import testapp.signals  # Ensure signals are connected
   ```

4. **Restart the Django shell** if running inside it.

---

## 🎯 **Pushing Updates to GitHub**
After making changes, commit and push them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated signals test setup"
git push origin main
```

---

### 🔹 **Now you have a fully working Django signals testing setup!** 🚀
```

---

### ✅ **Next Steps**
- Copy the content above and save it as `README.md` in your **GitHub repository**.
- Push it to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Added README.md with setup and testing instructions"
  git push origin main
  ```
- Now, anyone (including you) can easily set up and test the Django signals.

🚀 **Let me know if you need any modifications!** 😊
